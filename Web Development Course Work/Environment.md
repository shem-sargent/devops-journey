# Web Development Course Work - Environment

- Install VS Code 64-bit April 2020 (version 1.45)
  - Theme: Rainglow CodeCourse (seemed appropriately named and looks good to my eyes)
- Install Git for Windows 64-bit 2.26.2 from https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.26.2.windows.1/Git-2.26.2-64-bit.exe

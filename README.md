# My DevOps Journey

> A self-taught career systems administrator pauses to indulge his creative passion through web development. Perhaps to find a new calling. Perhaps to bridge between the known and unknown to reach DevOps oneness.

Covid-19 has changed the world, so they say. It has changed mine. Laid off, floundering a bit, I have taken stock and decided to use this unplanned carrer derailment to learn somthing new. Or should I say, to learn something *well*, to learn it *right*, to learn it *intentionally*, rather than scraping up bits and pieces where time permits and circumstances demand.

A web developer friend suggested Udemy and they had a sale I (and more importantly, my partner) couldn't resist: $10 or so for all their courses. I opted for a full stack web developer course and am now ready to dig in.

This is my effort at creating a sustained sense of accountability. I will record everything about this journey that I reasonably can here. If you like good reading as much as I do, I hope I don't dissappoint you. If you like technical rigor with bits of humor and nonsense and occasional rants, you may actually enjoy sharing my journey.

This is some of what I am starting with:
- Deep interest in all things technical since age eight.
- A fair a mount of eary experimentation with Apple BASIC, IBM/MSDOS BASIC (BASICA, GW-BASIC, or QBasic, anyone?) and Visual Basic (pre- .NET)
- An unnecessary enyclopedia of obscure and arcane geek pop culture exposure including MST3K, Monty Python, and *The Princess Bride*.
- A fascination with connecting technologies and the Internet going back to 2400 baud dial-up days figuring out which BBSes I could access by dialing locally and which ones would let me in without verifying my identity.
- Many years of tech support and workstation and server administration on Windows and, more recently, various Debian-based linux distributions, with Ubuntu at the top of the list.
- A lot of Windows Batch and PowerShell scripting, with a dash of Bash when needed.
- A previous ill-fated attempt to manage a web development project.
- I recently read *The Phoenix Project* and saw the light. I have promised myself that I will read *The Unicorn Project* if I get through this web development course and still want to try to get a related job.
- An appreciation for the need for balanced infrastructure security informed by preventing and recovering from cyber attacks and performing lots of vulnerability scans. Trying to close all those gaps is as senseless as a whack-a-mole game, but some layers of security are practical and necessary.

Let's see where this takes me!
